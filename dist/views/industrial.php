       <h2 class="subHdg">It’s more than just a floor</h2>
        <p class="mainP">As floors wear, rough spots and depressions can form. Luckily, concrete floors can have their deterioration stopped and the damage reversed with epoxy coatings. Just like potholes can damage your vehicle, these fissures can take a toll on your warehouse and manufacturing equipment. Increased maintenance costs and equipment downtime don’t have to be an inevitable part of your workplace. FX Coating’s floor coating treatments actually enable you to rebuild damaged floors, creating a finish that’s as good as new.</p>
        <p class="mainP">Choosing the right installation expert for your flooring coating project is paramount. FX Coating is a professional floor coating provider that specializes in agricultural, commercial, and industrial coating products.</p>
