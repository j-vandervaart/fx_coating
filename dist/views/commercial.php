       <p class="mainP">Protect valuable seed grain by preventing water & corrosion damage to your commercial grain elevators.</p>
       <p class="mainP">Water damage. It’s a grain operator’s worst nightmare. Grain storage units are constantly exposed to moisture and rain and are susceptible to damage and leakage, which ultimately can result in adulterated grain.</p>
       <p class="mainP">Luckily, you can avoid this costly form of grain storage failure entirely through the use of a grain bin base sealing and silo roof repairs. When professionally applied, a rubberized coating on the base and roof of your storage equipment will create an airtight base and waterproof barrier, protecting your bin floor from corrosion and damage.</p>

       <h2 class="subHdg">Permanently bond & waterproof your grain storage units</h2>
       <p class="mainP">FX Coating’s rubberized coating system for grain storage units and cement silo roofs features an advanced waterproofing membrane that can be applied over a wide range of substrates, including steel, concrete, wood, and old roof systems.</p>
       <p class="mainP">Designed to protect against water and corrosion damage, FX’s rubberized coating is flexible enough to adapt to storage units movements caused by temperature changes and fill cycles. Backed by a two-year limited warranty, our rubberized coatings have been known to last for 15 years or longer.</p>
       
       <h2 class="subHdg">Our installation process</h2>
       <p class="mainP">FX’s rubberized grain storage unit coatings and cement silo roof treatments are cold applied using a low-pressure, high-volume spray application. Quick and convenient, our rubberized coatings boast excellent bonding characteristics and a seamless elastometric membrane.</p>
       
       <h2 class="subHdg">Our advanced process is as follows:</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Power wash the storage units or roof that is to be coated.</li>
        <li>Apply a polyester seam cloth to any cracks or holes.</li>
        <li>This cloth is imbedded with rubber to provide extra protection on cracks and joints.</li>
        <li>A thick coating of rubber is sprayed to seal and protect the storage unit or roof.</li>
       </ul>
       
        <p class="mainP">Capable of being applied when the bin is full or empty, FX’s rubberized bin coating sets almost instantly, forming a seamless barrier.</p>

       <h2 class="subHdg">The benefits of rubberized coatings</h2>
        <p class="mainP">Rubberized grain storage units and roof coatings have an extremely high resistance to moisture. Unlike tar or polyurea coatings, which are easily compromised, rubberized coatings are designed to isolate leaks, preventing the spread of water and limiting the affected area.</p>

        <h2 class="subHdg">Grain storage units & silo rubberized coatings:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop water from seeping and leaching into silos</li>
            <li>Protect against corrosion at the base of bin</li>
            <li>Prevent grain spoilage, saving you thousands of dollars in lost profits</li>
            <li>Resist cracking, splitting, and delamination</li>
            <li>Extend the life of your bin</li>
       </ul>
