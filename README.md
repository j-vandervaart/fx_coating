# FX Coating Website Build

This is a responsive website build for a local business.

The primary technologies involved in this project are HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and SASS.

PHP is used within this project as a controller to load views and as a script for sending email. The PHP controller looks for changes in the URL using the $\_GET superglobal, and based on the value the controller loads in specific views. The result of this is a single page website that has the ability to load in varying content.

I also experimented with the .htaccess file to do some URL rewriting. The result was "prettier", more semantic, and SEO-friendly URLs.
